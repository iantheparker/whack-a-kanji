# Whack-A-Kanji Game

![Gameplay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iantheparker/whack-a-kanji/master/public/still.jpg)

You can whack a kanji [here](https://whack-a-kanji.netlify.com/), though this is definitely for advanced Japanese learners.
This is forked from [@RhodesPeter's whack-a-mole-react](https://github.com/RhodesPeter/whack-a-mole-react) and filled with fake AI-generated kanji from [@hardmaru's sketchRNN](https://github.com/hardmaru/sketch-rnn) and real kanji from [KanjiVG](http://kanjivg.tagaini.net/).
