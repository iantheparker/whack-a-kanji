Whack-a-Kanji is a little game for advanced kanji learners.
You can whack a kanji [here](https://whack-a-kanji.netlify.com/).
This is forked from [@RhodesPeter's whack-a-mole-react](https://github.com/RhodesPeter/whack-a-mole-react) and filled with fake AI-generated kanji from [@hardmaru's sketchRNN](https://github.com/hardmaru/sketch-rnn) and real kanji from [KanjiVG](http://kanjivg.tagaini.net/).

See my [fork of SketchRNN](https://github.com/iantheparker/sketch-rnn) if you're also trying to make sure that your generated kanji match the same style and dimensions of the real ones.
